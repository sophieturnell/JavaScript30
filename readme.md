### Notes, Reminders & Takeaways
**"data-..." attributes** embed bespoke data attributes on HTML elements. The stored (custom) data can then be used in the page's JavaScript to create a more engaging user experience (without any Ajax calls or server-side database queries).

**transition end events**  use inbuilt "transitionend" (small 'e') and occur when a CSS transition has completed.

**http://keycode.info/** for the number of each key.
**<kbd>** defines keyboard input
